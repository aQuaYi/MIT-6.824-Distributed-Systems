// ApplyMsg 是发送消息
// as each Raft peer becomes aware that successive log entries are
// committed, the peer should send an ApplyMsg to the service (or
// tester) on the same server, via the applyCh passed to Make(). set
// CommandValid to true to indicate that the ApplyMsg contains a newly
// committed log entry.
//
// in Lab 3 you'll want to send other kinds of messages (e.g.,
// snapshots) on the applyCh; at that point you can add fields to
// ApplyMsg, but set CommandValid to false for these other uses.
//
type ApplyMsg struct {
	Snapshot     []byte
	UseSnapshot  bool
	CommandValid bool
	Command      interface{}
	CommandIndex int
